# NAME

John::Doe - Test case duplicate file names in distribution

# SYNOPSIS

    use John::Doe;

# DESCRIPTION

Don't install or use it, except for testing module toolchains.

This distribution contains files in `lib/`, `t/` and `share/` written in case variants.

At the time of release version 0.00 this distribution builds and passes all tests.

On environments with case insensitive filenames only one variant of the files survives.
